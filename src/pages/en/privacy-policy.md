## General Provisions

This Privacy Policy describes the personal data collected and processed by BALI ZEN SRL in the context of providing therapeutic and relaxation massage services. This document is governed by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and is supplemented by the provisions of Law No. 190/2018 regarding measures for its implementation.

The personal data operator is BALI ZEN SRL, located in Ploiești, Str. Diligenței, Nr. 1, Ap. 2, Prahova County, registered in the Trade Register under no. J2019000696209, CUI 40893761, a legal entity that establishes the purposes and means of processing personal data of its clients. For any request related to the processing of your personal data, you can contact us at contact@balizen.ro or by phone at 0733211325.

## Data Collected and Its Use

In order to provide services under optimal conditions of safety and quality, BALI ZEN SRL requests the provision of certain personal identification information. The purpose of requesting data is our ability to provide you with the services you request in a safe, personalized, and efficient manner.

Personal data is collected exclusively in cases where it is voluntarily provided by clients during the booking process and consultation prior to service provision. Data may be requested at the time of the first telephone or online booking, at the time of presentation at the salon for the first massage session, as well as during the contractual relationship, when changes occur in health status or client contact information.

The collection of personal data is carried out for the following purposes:

- for managing bookings and the contractual relationship with clients
- for assessing health status and identifying any contraindications for providing massage services
- for personalizing massage techniques and intensity according to the individual needs of each client
- for providing services at home when the client opts for this option
- for making commercial communications with the express consent of the client

### Identification and Contact Data

To access our services and to offer you an experience suitable to your needs, it is necessary to provide certain identification and contact data. For booking and providing services, BALI ZEN SRL will request your first and last name, phone number, and email address. This information is necessary to identify you as a client, to contact you to confirm bookings, to send reminders and schedule changes, as well as for subsequent communications related to contracted services.

Your date of birth and age are requested to ensure that the services offered are appropriate and safe for you, as well as to be able to send you greetings and special offers on your birthday, if you have opted to receive commercial communications. Your home address is requested exclusively in situations where you opt for massage services provided at home.

### Health Status Data

In order to provide massage services under maximum safety conditions and to avoid any risk to your health, BALI ZEN SRL collects and processes data regarding your health status. This information is essential to assess whether providing massage services is safe and appropriate in your case, as well as to adapt massage techniques and intensity to individual needs and limitations.

The medical data collected includes information about medications you are currently taking, any allergies to oils, lotions, or cosmetic products used during massage, as well as information about pregnancy or breastfeeding in the case of female persons. We also request information about the existence of active medical supervision or ongoing medical treatment, to ensure that massage services do not interfere with received medical recommendations.

A significant portion of the information collected concerns pre-existing medical conditions, including endocrine, cardiovascular, dermatological, digestive, musculoskeletal, neurological, or oncological conditions. We collect information about recent injuries or medical procedures undergone in the last 2 years, as well as any other health conditions that may require special precautions during massage.

For personalizing the experience and ensuring your comfort, we collect information about your previous experience with massage services, the reason you wish to benefit from our services, your preferences regarding the level of pressure applied, as well as specific areas of discomfort or areas you wish to be avoided during the session.

The collection of this data is essential for:

- assessing the possibility of providing massage services under safe conditions
- adapting massage techniques to the specific needs and limitations of each client
- identifying contraindications and preventing risks to your health
- ensuring an optimal level of comfort and safety during massage sessions

Processing of this health data is carried out exclusively on the basis of your explicit, freely expressed, and informed consent. Health data are special categories of personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation, and their processing is permitted only under strict conditions. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, but this may make it impossible to provide massage services under safe conditions, which is why we reserve the right to refuse service provision in the absence of this essential information.

## Legal Bases for Processing

Processing of your personal data is carried out on the basis of several legal grounds, depending on the category of data and the purpose of processing. For identification and contact data, the legal grounds are represented by the execution of the service contract concluded between you and BALI ZEN SRL, this processing being necessary to fulfill the contractual obligations assumed, as well as the legitimate interest of the operator to manage the relationship with its clients and to ensure the efficient operation of the activity.

For health status data, the legal grounds consist of your explicit and express consent, obtained freely and knowingly, this category of data being classified as sensitive personal data requiring an increased level of protection. For commercial communications, the legal grounds are represented by your express consent to receive offers and promotions.

For archiving documents and maintaining accounting and fiscal records, the legal grounds consist of legal obligations incumbent on the operator under applicable fiscal and accounting legislation, this data being retained for the period required by law. In all cases, data processing is carried out in accordance with the principles provided by the General Data Protection Regulation.

## Protection and Management of Personal Data

To protect your personal data, BALI ZEN SRL adopts various security strategies, which include technical, administrative, and organizational measures. These involve restricting access to data, training staff, monitoring systems, and periodic risk assessment, thus ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of your information.

Physical documents containing personal data and health status information are stored under secure conditions, access to them being strictly limited to authorized personnel. At the end of the legal retention period, documents are destroyed. For electronic data, measures are implemented to protect access and secure the computer systems used.

However, no entity can guarantee absolute data security against all threats, so for protecting personal data, it is your duty to also adopt prudent and diligent conduct to protect your personal data against unauthorized access or inappropriate use.

### Retention of Personal Data

BALI ZEN SRL will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy, except in situations where legal provisions establish or permit a different retention period. For identification and contact data, the retention period is 3 years from the last service provision, this period being considered reasonable for maintaining a relationship with clients and for any subsequent booking requests. If you have opted to receive commercial communications, your contact data will be retained until you withdraw your consent for this type of communication.

For health status data, the retention period is 5 years from the last service provision or until you withdraw your consent, whichever occurs first.

## Sharing Data with Third Parties

BALI ZEN SRL respects the confidentiality of your data and does not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties for commercial purposes. Your data may be disclosed exclusively in strictly necessary situations and only to the extent that this is required by law or is necessary for providing contracted services.

In relations with public authorities, BALI ZEN SRL may be required by law to provide certain information to tax authorities, police, courts, or other competent authorities, when there is a legal request in this regard or when legislation requires reporting certain information. In such situations, we will disclose only strictly necessary data requested through official documents, fully respecting applicable legal provisions.

If BALI ZEN SRL uses external services for managing certain aspects of the activity, such as accounting services, IT services for maintaining computer systems, or other specialized services, we will conclude data processing agreements that guarantee that these service providers will process your data exclusively according to our instructions and will implement adequate security measures for their protection. These providers act as authorized processors of the operator and do not have the right to use data for their own purposes.

In exceptional situations, when your health or life is in imminent danger and emergency medical services intervention is needed, BALI ZEN SRL reserves the right to communicate relevant information about your health status to emergency medical personnel, to facilitate providing appropriate medical assistance.

BALI ZEN SRL does not transfer personal data outside the European Economic Area. In the event that such a transfer would become necessary, we will ensure the existence of adequate safeguards provided by the General Data Protection Regulation and will obtain your explicit consent, where required by applicable legislation.

## Your Rights

In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation, you benefit from a series of rights that give you control over how your personal data is processed. These rights can be exercised by sending a written request to our headquarters or to the email address mentioned at the beginning of this document.

### Right of Access

The right of access gives you the possibility to obtain confirmation as to whether or not we process personal data concerning you and, if so, access to such data and information regarding the purposes of processing, categories of data processed, recipients or categories of recipients to whom data has been or will be disclosed, the period for which data will be stored, your rights, the possibility to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority, as well as any other relevant information about processing.

### Right to Rectification

The right to rectification allows you to obtain immediate rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning you. Having regard to the purposes of processing, you have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.

### Right to Erasure of Data

The right to erasure of data, also known as the right to be forgotten, gives you the possibility to obtain from us the erasure of personal data concerning you without undue delay, under certain circumstances. You can request erasure of data when they are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected, when you withdraw consent on the basis of which processing takes place and there is no other legal ground for processing, when you object to processing and there are no overriding legitimate grounds, when data has been unlawfully processed, or when data must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation. This right does not apply to the extent that processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation requiring processing under applicable law or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.

### Right to Restriction of Processing

The right to restriction of processing allows you to obtain from us restriction of processing in situations where you contest the accuracy of data, for a period enabling us to verify accuracy, when processing is unlawful and you oppose erasure, requesting instead restriction of their use, when we no longer need the personal data for processing purposes but you require them for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, or when you have objected to processing, pending verification of whether our legitimate grounds override yours.

### Right to Data Portability

The right to data portability gives you the possibility to receive personal data concerning you that you have provided to the operator in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, as well as the right to have such data transmitted directly to another operator, where technically feasible.

### Right to Object

The right to object allows you to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to processing of personal data concerning you. If you exercise this right, BALI ZEN SRL will no longer process personal data, except where we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds that justify processing and override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or where processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. You have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes.

### Right Not to Be Subject to Automated Decision-Making

The right not to be subject to automated decision-making protects you against decisions that produce legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affect you, when such decisions are made solely on the basis of automated processing, including profiling. BALI ZEN SRL does not currently use automated decision-making systems, but if this were to happen in the future, you will be informed accordingly and granted necessary safeguards.

### Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Supervisory Authority

The right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority gives you the possibility to contact the National Supervisory Authority for Personal Data Processing if you consider that processing of your personal data violates the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation. The authority can be contacted at B-dul G-ral. Gheorghe Magheru nr. 28-30, Sector 1, Bucharest, by email at anspdcp@dataprotection.ro, by phone at +40.318.059.211, or by accessing www.dataprotection.ro. Exercising this right does not prejudice your right to address the courts.

## Making Communications
